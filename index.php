The swim is a shorter, more manageable 1/4 mile distance, (instead of the standard 1/2-mile Sprint distance swim), 10 mile bike ride (vs 12 miles and it's a 2 loop course making it very spectator friendly!) and a flat 2 mile run (vs 3 mile sprint course).</p><br><br>
                
                <h4>Half Marathon COURSE</h4><br>

Once finished, runners can enjoy the finish line festivities, including the Sports & Fitness Expo and live entertainment. Post-race refreshments will be provided and the Awards Ceremony for the Half-Marathon will begin once the results have been certified.</p><br><br>
                
                <h4>10k COURSE</h4><br>
                
                <p>The 10K event starts and finishes in the Athletes Village. The paths are approximately 6 ft wide, perfectly paved and wind around through the forest. Each course has only two small hills with a minimal elevation gain to navigate and a fast downhill to flat finish to the roaring cheers of the crowd.</p><br><br>
                
                <h4>Splash n' Dash</h4> 
                
                <p>Kids event for participants ages 4 to 15. This is a 100 yard swim and a 50 yard dash.</p><br><br>
